This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

=======
An early proof of concept idea for GT was to allow users to look up the next likeliest opinion/demographic/thought of any other, such that San Francisco, or any group, could become functionally self-aware at the group level with a single website; people need only look up the next likeliest cohort of the cohort "I live in SF", and you have not only the actual voice of the group, shown TO the group in near realtime, just as our own self-representations (story) is fed back to us in our minds in realtime, giving us functional self awareness. It could be a voting network, belief/knowledge network, health/epidemiology network, social justice endgame, to the extent it can be designed and implemented properly. It would be a technical higher power - something greater than ourselves with which we can be a part of, as if the web were a sky in which we could fly together like a flock of birds. That's the dream. That's also next in line in accordance with the trajectory of human sociocultural evolution, from bands, to tribes, to kingdoms, to democracies, to web economics to ever higher levels of integrating human complexity. What emerging technology will allow us to build the crucially needed trust between us to survive one another as the avalanche of existential burdens come down upon us with ever-increasing scientific insights? 

Explaining Globethoughts to a 5 year old:
"Imagine if everyone in your class could share what they think about things, themselves and others, privately but to a common board, like their favorite colors or what makes them happy. Now imagine if the whole class could see what everyone thinks together, about anything! It's like a magical mirror of the group to each individual that helps you and your friends communicate, understand each other, and cooperate towards fun things so they don't have to fight so much."

To a teenager:
"It's like if TikTok and Twitter had a baby that was actually trying to solve real problems. Instead of just following people, you join and create 'cohorts' - groups of anonymous individuals around descriptions that represent who you are and what you believe in. The more people join more cohorts, the more we can see how different types of individuals and whole groups connect and communicate. It's kind of like a social network that reveals the hidden patterns in how different communities think and relate to each other, safely, independently, allowing us to answer the questions we have for one another but have a hard time asking and answering in person. It could help break down stereotypes and prejudices, silently revealing to us how we can avoid conflicts with one another, and revealing new ways of relating to all types of people. All of us are infinitely dynamic. We all belong to an infinite number of demographics / cohorts. And we are already collective intelligences anyways, even as individual humans. As we are bundles of cooperating nerve cells, and globethoughts is a bundle of cooperating humans, trusting each other with the right network."

For a politician:
"Globethoughts is an innovative platform that provides unprecedented insight into constituent values, beliefs, and concerns across any demographic you can imagine. Unlike traditional polling or social media, it creates a dynamic map of how different communities' interests and attributes overlap and diverge, enabling more informed policy-making and communication strategies. It's a powerful tool for understanding not just what different groups think, but how their perspectives interconnect and diverge. This site has strong potential for generating essential knowledge for effective governance in our increasingly complex society."

For a CEO or Businessman:
"Globethoughts is a novel web platform aimed at developing the technical foundation for a collective human intelligence. It's a way for human populations to become functionally self-aware at the group level, not unlike how neurons are self aware at the level of the brain, rather than of themselves as neurons. Humans, as the most culturally developed species on earth by far, are actually not very self aware of themselves as populations - collectively (or not much anyway, aside from the circulation of papers in academic, political and media circles). We Homo Sapiens Sapiens circa 2025 are highly aware of our self-representations in the form of stories about our bodies. But if we of our own liberty chose to participate in a network that would reveal the whole to the individual in near-realtime, we would learn to cooperate and behave with as much unity as we'd perceive it on the screen of our devices. We, AS groups, could function with self-awareness at the group level, safely and with the same independence we have over the screen of whatever device we use. As the representation of the group is produced by individuals and fed back to each individual, every one of u could know wat it's like to BE not the individual but the whole, if only for a moment, and another moment, and another. We could all become part of something greater than ourselves, by discovering new dimensions of ourselves. Help me create this platform. I need not only your logistical support, but you fresh perspective on this project that I've been working on for nearly two decades. All you need do is watch me run the experiment with a few volunteers to demonstrate how a group can behave with functional self-awareness, and then ask yourself how many of the prospective paths this could take are worth your attention.

For a university professor:
"This platform implements a novel approach to studying collective intelligence and social epistemology through what we might call 'semantic demography.' Users create and join cohorts - textual expressions that function as both demographic identifiers and knowledge claims. The system maps not only the social networks between users, but the semantic networks between ideas, enabling us to study how beliefs, values, and identities propagate and interact across populations. It's particularly interesting from a computational social science perspective, as it provides structured data about how different forms of knowledge and identity intersect across communities."

For a fellow web developer:
"It's a Node/Express/MongoDB application that maps both social and semantic networks through a unique data structure. The core schemas track bi-directional relationships between users and what we call 'cohorts' - text strings that users can create and endorse. These cohorts function as both social groups and knowledge claims, creating a rich graph that can be traversed either socially (shared users between cohorts) or semantically (shared topics, inference relationships, etc).

// Key features:
// - Bidirectional user<->cohort relationships
// - Derived social network data (cohortsUids)
// - Semantic relationships between cohorts
// - Flexible sorting/filtering on both social and semantic dimensions

The interesting part is how this enables us to sort and filter cohorts based on either social relationships (shared users) or semantic relationships (topics, inference types, etc), creating a rich exploration space. The front-end uses EJS templates with sortable views that can dynamically recalculate cohort relationships based on user-selected criteria. We're also keeping the architecture flexible enough to potentially integrate with AI for more sophisticated semantic analysis down the line."

Each description maintains the core concept while adjusting the language, focus, and level of technical detail for the audience. The children's version focuses on simple sharing and understanding, the teen version draws parallels with familiar social media while emphasizing real-world impact, the political version highlights governance applications, the academic version foregrounds theoretical implications, and the developer version dives into the technical architecture.
