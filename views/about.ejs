<label>About Globethoughts:</label>
<br>
<p>Globethoughts is a technical means of proving connection to a power greater than ourselves - our communities, however we choose them to be.</p>
<br>
<label>For a 5 year old:</label>
<p>
    "Imagine if everyone in your class could share what they think about things, like their favorite colors or what makes them happy. Now imagine if the whole class could see what everyone thinks together! It's like a magical mirror that helps your whole class understand each other better."

<label>For a teenager:</label>
<p>
    "It's like if TikTok and Twitter had a baby that was actually trying to solve real problems. Instead of just following people, you join and create 'cultures' - groups that represent who you are and what you believe in. The more people join these cultures, the more we can see how different groups connect and understand each other. It's kind of like a social network that reveals the hidden patterns in how different communities think and relate to each other. No cap, it could help break down stereotypes and show us what we all have in common fr fr."

<label>For a politician:</label>
<p>
    "Globethoughts is an innovative platform that provides unprecedented insight into constituent values, beliefs, and concerns across any demographic you can imagine. Unlike traditional polling or social media, it creates a dynamic map of how different communities' interests overlap and diverge, enabling more informed policy-making and communication strategies. It's a powerful tool for understanding not just what different groups think, but how their perspectives interconnect - essential knowledge for effective governance in our increasingly complex society."

<label>For a university professor:</label>
<p>
    "This platform implements a novel approach to studying collective intelligence and social epistemology through what we might call 'semantic demography.' Users create and join cohorts - textual expressions that function as both demographic identifiers and knowledge claims. The system maps not only the social networks between users, but the semantic networks between ideas, enabling us to study how beliefs, values, and identities propagate and interact across populations. It's particularly interesting from a computational social science perspective, as it provides structured data about how different forms of knowledge and identity intersect across communities."
</p>
<label>For a fellow web developer:</label>
<p>
    "It's a Node/Express/MongoDB application that maps both social and semantic networks through a unique data structure. The core schemas track bi-directional relationships between users and what we call 'cohorts' - text strings that users can create and endorse. These cohorts function as both social groups and knowledge claims, creating a rich graph that can be traversed either socially (shared users between cohorts) or semantically (shared topics, inference relationships, etc).
